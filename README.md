Fix the Max Payne 1 window does not run in full screen mode problem under Windows 10. Why this fix? This fix is compatible with RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS). On the other hand SweetFX doesn't.

# Installation

Download the latest binaries from https://github.com/winteryoung/maxpaynestarter/releases. Unzip everything in the 7z
archive to the Max Payne installation directory (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Max Payne). Run your Max Payne game
from `maxpaynestarter.bat` every time.

# Requirements

This app requires Java 8 to run.
